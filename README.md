lesjoiesducode-feedly-chrome-extension
======================================

When using the Feedly (RSS reader) to watch the Tumblr called "Les joies du code", the GIF in the articles is not displayed and the user has to go to the website to see it. The extension get the GIF for you and add it into Feedly.

Some jQuery request are definitely not optimized, feel free to fork and PR :)
